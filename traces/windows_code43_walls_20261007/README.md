# Windows Code43: one implementation gap per boot

**STATUS: RESEARCH, 2026-10-07.** Owner-directed continuation after
[exact request decoding](../windows_exact_decode_20261007/README.md). No Windows
success or master-promotion claim. Borrowed RTX4070; host595.91.07 remains attached
to its ordinary display driver. Only owned fresh-overlay Kayfabe VMs are used.

## First repair: Device-shared default VA resolution

The failing COPY2 channel has hVASpace=0 under client c1d00012. Its Device
explicitly shares client c1d00002's Device default. The old resolver searches only
the channel client's namespace and returns INVALID_STATE before channel creation.

The repair retains Device allocation facts in the graph, records a bounded
same-GPU Device-share relationship in ChannelPolicy, and resolves the canonical
VA's client and handle. Explicit channel, context-share and TSG declarations
retain their existing precedence. The existing mirror and channel birth checks
still decide whether actual GPU resources are ready; this does not bypass them.

Source: OGKM580.65.06 commit307159f2623d3bf45feb9177bd2da52ffbc5ddf9,
`src/nvidia/src/kernel/gpu/device_share.c:91` (share by client and GPU instance),
`src/nvidia/src/kernel/mem_mgr/vaspace.c:183` (implicit default permitted except
MULTIPLE_VASPACES). Mode constants are generated from OGKM580.159.04 headers by
`crates/kf-abi/gen/`; no captured per-die or host-privileged facts are added.

Missing/ambiguous targets, cross-GPU targets, unknown/private modes and cycles
refuse resolution. Traversal is capped at32 and declarations at the existing
MAX_LIVE_HANDLES budget. Target Device/client destruction revokes dependent
resolution; numeric handle reuse cannot revive it. Freeing the transient VA
handle retains the Device default, as the existing lifetime model requires.
This conservative support does not implement cross-Device VA reference retention
after the target Device is destroyed; existing live GPU channels retain their
ordinary resource lifetime and new births fail closed.

Regression tests exercise distinct Device handle values, canonical namespace,
local-default suppression for an explicit share, transient-VA free, target free,
handle reuse, missing targets, cross-GPU targets, explicit-VA-only mode and cycles.
The framebuffer MemoryList rejection and latency-buffer query are independent
remaining gaps; this iteration changes neither.

Local validation before the first hardware boot: all611 kf-rm tests pass,
including12 channel-link tests. Targeted kf-rm/kf-qemu Clippy reports zero new
debt (207 existing); formatting, diff and documentation claims checks pass.

## Run16: VA wall removed, Code43 persists

Product/QEMU `c30ee9106f7c434abcd359080f4fbfeb39b8f141`; GPU gates9/9,
11/11 USER births. [Command](run16-command.json), [settled status](run16-status.json),
[trace](run16-qemu.log.gz), [excerpt](run16-requests.log),
[clean completion](run16-complete.json), [host health](run16-host-health.txt).

The COPY2 allocation now returns0 and creates an actual Translated host channel
with PRIVILEGED_CHANNEL=0 and privilege=USER, on canonical VA
c1d00002:ff000870. No mirror/birth refusal remains for that request. The next
allocation, NV50_DEFERRED_API_CLASS=0x5080 under the new channel, returns0x56;
the channel is retired with forwarded=0 and submissions=0. Windows retains
Code43/smi9; display still reaches8330 methods but zero UPDATEs/scanouts.
The FBMEM registration and FIFO latency-buffer query still refuse. No exact
RPC-to-Windows-assertion causal claim is made.

Fresh run16 watchdog [recovery](run16-recovery.log) and
[comparison](run16-watchdog-comparison.json):24 saved assertions, first21 identical
to run13; tail hints change from3901fd/391f76/1a1267d to1a1267d/1a3704b/1959d9f.
The earlier1a103e6 assertion is still inside the matching prefix. This does not
prove which RPC caused the tail assertions. The outer NVCD remains one byte
short; complete journal records are usable, no valid-checksum claim. The linked
run16 recovery receipt records read-only NBD/NTFS and cleanup; raw dump remains private.

## Second repair: bounded framebuffer MemoryList registration

The function4 request registers class82, flags48040200, one direct PFN ea6e0,
length128KiB. Its span ea6e0000..ea700000 lies in the VM's usable framebuffer
heap. The former SYSRAM-only class/location/flag decoder refused it.

FBMEM admission is explicit on the audited580.65.06 and580.159.04 guest contracts;
other rows retain SYSTEM-only admission. Class, location and GPU-cache mask come
from the existing public C compiler artifacts. The decoder still requires an
exact direct one-PFN descriptor, contiguous pitch storage, safe arithmetic and
reviewed flags. A separate backing tag prevents video PFNs from reaching guest
RAM topology or CPU-copy authority. SYSTEM cannot name VIDMEM and FBMEM cannot
name PCI RAM. Original flags are retained; registration creates no new mapping.

The object seat validates the live original Device/Subdevice/Client ancestry,
then checks the whole page-rounded span in one unreserved heap region of this
VM's immutable FbLayout. It registers a typed graph resource referencing that
existing storage, with the same parent/device lifetime, quota, duplicate and
free semantics as SYSTEM registration. Firmware carveouts, overflow and outside
store ranges refuse without mutation. No host PFN is forwarded. FB descriptors
mint no RAM generation/CPU-access token; future GPU consumers require their own
checked resource resolution. This is object registration, not a GPU submission.

The only file difference is an extra HW-resource reference increment at740 for
a nonzero source HW-resource handle, which this function4 subset does not carry.
The shared FBMEM branch validates one contiguous PFN and extent against the
Device FB heap before constructing the memory resource (lines418..530).
This is source-backed constructor coverage, not proof that public GSP dispatcher
code or Windows binary internals are available.

Second-repair local validation:18 focused MemoryList tests across ABI, RM, QEMU
and the full policy chain pass; all612 kf-rm tests pass. Clippy across kf-abi,
kf-rm and kf-qemu reports zero new debt (208 existing). Formatting/diff checks
pass. Hardware result pending until a fresh source-pinned Windows boot.
