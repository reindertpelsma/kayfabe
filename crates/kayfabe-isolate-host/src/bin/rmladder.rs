//! ★ The bring-up ladder, as a program — `host_execution_plane.md` §4.
//!
//! > *"The ladder is cheap and is written **before** the first bench run, not after — each
//! > rung naming what is attempted and what 'working' looks like, so a failure localises to
//! > a layer."*
//!
//! Every design in this project has been wrong about six times per stage against a
//! *cooperative* fixture. Meeting a real driver without a ladder means debugging several
//! failures at once with no idea which layer owns them. So this walks the rungs one at a
//! time, prints each outcome, and stops at the first one that does not work — with the rung
//! name in the message.
//!
//! It is deliberately a **separate binary from the isolate**. The isolate is a sandboxed
//! child that speaks a protocol; this is a diagnostic a human runs on a bench box, and
//! conflating the two would put a human-facing argument parser and a `println!` inside the
//! process that faces a hostile guest.
