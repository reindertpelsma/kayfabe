//! ★★ The **safe** half of the hypervisor shim — every decision the adapter makes when a
//! foreign C shim calls into it, expressed without a single address.
//!
//! # Why this module exists at all, and why it is not in [`crate::shim_unsafe`]
//!
//! `l2_qemu_adapter.md` §2.3 draws the seam as *"the C never calls Rust logic and Rust never
//! calls C logic; both call primitives"*. That leaves an unstated question: **where does the
//! translation live?** A status code is not a primitive — somebody has to decide that
//! [`kayfabe_vmm::VmmError::Unsupported`] carrying [`kayfabe_vmm_qemu::BELOW_FLOOR`] is a
//! *refusal to realize* and not a *malformed request*, and that decision is logic.
//!
//! Putting it beside the address arithmetic would make it untestable without a hypervisor,
//! which is the exact trap `l2_qemu_adapter.md` §10's stage table is built to avoid: stages
//! Q0 and Q1 are machine-free *on purpose*, and a translation layer that could only be
//! exercised from inside a hypervisor would quietly move this crate's testable surface to
//! zero.
//!
//! So the split inside the crate mirrors the split between the crates:
//!
//! ```text
//!   C shim  ──▶  shim_unsafe.rs   (addresses, the keyword, ~1 line per call)
//!                      │  &dyn QemuHost, &[BarPlacement], plain integers
//!                      ▼
//!                  shim.rs        (this module — every decision, zero addresses)
//!                      │
//!                      ▼
//!            kayfabe_vmm_qemu::QemuMachine
//! ```
//!
//! Everything here is driven by [`kayfabe_vmm_qemu::mock_host::MockQemuHost`] in
//! `tests/shim_logic.rs`, with no hypervisor present.
//!
//! # ★ The status vocabulary is NARROWER than the error type, deliberately
//!
//! [`Status`] has five variants and [`kayfabe_vmm::VmmError`] has five that do not line up
//! with them. That is not sloppiness: a C caller can act on *"the operator must change the
//! command line"* ([`Status::Busy`]), *"this build can never work"* ([`Status::Unsupported`])
//! and *"we asked for something impossible"* ([`Status::Malformed`]), and cannot act on the
//! difference between a bad guest-physical address and a bad region id. **The diagnostic
//! sentence carries the detail** — [`classify`] returns the error's own `&'static str`
//! wherever it has one, so nothing is lost, it is merely not branched on.
